## International Tuition Payments Are Broken
<img src="./images/problem.png" alt="logo" width="800">
While global remittance continues to innovate and grow rapidly, the education segment has remained stagnant. There's little innovation since the early 2000s - the numbers speak for themselves. Parents and students who study abroad still have a undergo a lumbersome process and pay exorbitant fees (often without knowing it).

&nbsp;

For example, a Chinese student going to Emory University pay ~$73,000 per financial year. Banks and credit companies would charge up to 3-8% (processing fee, FX mark up, additional fee) to process the payment and settle in 3-7 business days. That's ~$5,840 per year per student for tuition alone. At a larger pciture, Emory University is home to nearly 3,300 international students, which translates to ~$19,270,000, or ~$19.3M just in fees from one university.

## A Massive, Growing Market Yet to be Captured

Among all the key corridors in the global market, Intuipay will focus on China (25%, 1.4M), India (29%, 1.6M) and their nearby countries / nations / regions. India and Greater China are the world's largest and fastest growing markets for education. It's important to note that both also have the history of investing heavily into education.

&nbsp;

While both markets are strict in terms of cross-border payment policies, there are methods to fulfill the requirements while being compliant. Being compliant could be a key barrier of entry and a long-term competitive advantage down the line.
